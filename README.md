# Instructions
This project started form the [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page) that contained a template for a static landing page.  Modifications were made to the HTML, CSS files to add secitions and styles, and a javascript file was written to create a dynamic navigation experirence as seen in the screenshots.

# Installation
To install the code, use `git clone` to copy the repo locally.  Alternatively you can download the files from this repository.

# Usage
To view the completed webpage, open `index.html` in a browser.  To make modifications, use the text editor of choice.  For this project I used VS Code.  The directory structure is as follows:

---sytles.css   css sytlesheet
-js             directory for javascript
